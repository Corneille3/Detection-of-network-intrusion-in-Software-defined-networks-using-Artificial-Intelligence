# Detection-of-network-intrusion-in-Software-defined-networks-using-Artificial-Intelligence
One of the potential ideas for the future Internet has recently appeared, and it is called Software Defined Networking (SDN). We have the potential to improve our network security thanks to SDN's logical controller centralization and global network awareness. SDN does, however, also offer a rise in possible dangers. In this study, we use deep learning and machine learning methods to identify flow-based anomalies in an SDN setting. For an intrusion detection system, we create a Neural Network model and train it using the NSLKDD Dataset. We have developed two Deep Neural Networks for Network Intrusion Detection System  (NIDS). One model detects if the attack is normal traffic or a mallicious attack. Another model detects the attack and categorises it into the major classes of attacks in SDN. Both model has better accuracy
